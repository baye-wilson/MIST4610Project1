## Ten Queries
1. This query finds the average box office sales for each director and only includes directors whose movies have earned more than $10 million on average. It groups the data by director and calculates both the number of movies directed and the average total sales of those movies. The results are then ordered so the highest-earning directors appear first.

This query helps identify which directors consistently create financially successful films. By filtering for directors with an average above $10 million, managers or studios can easily see which directors are the most profitable.

2. This query lists all movies in the database in the order they were released, starting with the earliest.

This helps users quickly see the timeline of movie releases, which can be useful for analyzing trends or understanding how the catalog of films has developed over time.

3.This query finds actors who have appeared in at least two movies, showing how many films they acted in, their total box office sales, and the average tickets sold across those films.

This helps identify which actors provide the most success for sales across multiple projects. Producers and studios can use this information to prioritize these higher earning actors in future films, ensuring stronger ticket sales and more of an audience appeal.
